Welcome to vcad! In this tutorial, you'll create your first 3D shape—a simple cube. This is the "Hello World" of CAD.

## Creating a Cube

Every vcad model starts with a **primitive**—a basic shape like a cube, cylinder, or sphere. Here's how to create a cube:

<Playground exampleId="cube" />

## What's happening here?

- `Part::cube()` creates a new cube primitive
- The first argument (`"my_cube"`) is the part name
- The next three arguments are width, depth, and height in millimeters
- `write_stl()` exports the geometry to a file

<Callout type="tip" title="Try it yourself">
In the playground above, try changing the cube dimensions. Make it taller, wider, or turn it into a thin plate. Notice how the 3D preview updates automatically.

## The Part Type

In vcad, everything is a `Part`. A Part represents 3D geometry that you can transform, combine with other parts, and export to various formats.

The basic primitives are:

| Primitive | Parameters |
|-----------|------------|
| `Part::cube()` | name, width, depth, height |
| `Part::cylinder()` | name, radius, height, segments |
| `Part::sphere()` | name, radius, segments |
| `Part::cone()` | name, bottom_radius, top_radius, height, segments |

## Centered Variants

By default, `Part::cube()` places the corner at the origin. For many modeling tasks, it's more convenient to have the shape centered:

```rust
use vcad::centered_cube;

// Centered at origin
let cube = centered_cube("box", 30.0, 30.0, 30.0);
```

The centered variants (`centered_cube`, `centered_cylinder`) place the geometry's center at the origin, making it easier to combine shapes.

## Next Steps

Now that you can create basic shapes, let's learn how to **transform** them—move them around, rotate them, and scale them to different sizes.

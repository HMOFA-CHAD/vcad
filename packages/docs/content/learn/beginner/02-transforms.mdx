Now that you can create basic shapes, let's learn how to move them around. **Transforms** change a part's position, orientation, or size without changing its fundamental shape.

## Translate (Move)

The `.translate()` method moves a part by the specified amount in each direction:

```rust
use vcad::Part;

let cube = Part::cube("box", 20.0, 20.0, 20.0);
let moved = cube.translate(50.0, 0.0, 10.0);
// Moves 50mm in X, 0 in Y, 10mm in Z
```

<Callout type="info">
Positive X goes right, positive Y goes forward (into the screen), and positive Z goes up. This is the standard right-handed coordinate system used in most CAD software.
</Callout>

## Rotate

The `.rotate()` method rotates a part around the origin. Angles are in **degrees**:

```rust
let cube = Part::cube("box", 20.0, 20.0, 20.0);
let rotated = cube.rotate(0.0, 0.0, 45.0);
// Rotates 45° around the Z axis
```

Rotation order is X, then Y, then Z. For complex rotations, consider applying one axis at a time.

## Scale

The `.scale()` method changes the size of a part:

```rust
let cube = Part::cube("box", 10.0, 10.0, 10.0);
let scaled = cube.scale(2.0, 1.0, 0.5);
// 2x in X, unchanged in Y, half in Z
```

For uniform scaling, use `.scale_uniform()`:

```rust
let bigger = cube.scale_uniform(2.0);  // 2x in all directions
```

## Mirror

Mirror creates a reflected copy across a plane:

```rust
let part = Part::cube("box", 10.0, 20.0, 5.0);
let mirrored_x = part.mirror_x();  // Mirror across YZ plane
let mirrored_y = part.mirror_y();  // Mirror across XZ plane
let mirrored_z = part.mirror_z();  // Mirror across XY plane
```

<Callout type="tip" title="Symmetric Parts">
Use mirror to create symmetric parts. Model half of a bracket, then combine it with its mirror image for a perfectly symmetric result.
</Callout>

## Chaining Transforms

Transforms can be chained together. Each transform returns a new Part:

```rust
let result = Part::cube("box", 10.0, 10.0, 10.0)
    .translate(-5.0, -5.0, 0.0)  // Center on X/Y
    .rotate(0.0, 0.0, 45.0)       // Rotate
    .translate(50.0, 0.0, 0.0);   // Move into position
```

<Callout type="warning" title="Order matters">
Transform order matters! Rotating then translating gives different results than translating then rotating. Think of each transform as modifying the current position.
</Callout>

## Transform Reference

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `.translate(x, y, z)` | Move by offset |
| `.rotate(x, y, z)` | Rotate in degrees |
| `.scale(x, y, z)` | Non-uniform scale |
| `.scale_uniform(s)` | Uniform scale |
| `.mirror_x()` | Mirror across YZ plane |
| `.mirror_y()` | Mirror across XZ plane |
| `.mirror_z()` | Mirror across XY plane |

## Next Steps

Now that you can position parts, let's learn how to **combine** them using boolean operations. You'll create your first hole!

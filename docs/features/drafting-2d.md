# 2D Drafting

Create technical drawings with orthographic projections and dimensions for manufacturing and documentation.

## Status

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| State | `shipped` |
| Owner | `n/a` |
| Priority | `p0` |
| Effort | `n/a` (complete) |

## Problem

Manufacturing and engineering workflows require professional technical drawings:

1. **Manufacturing** needs precise 2D drawings with dimensions and tolerances for fabrication
2. **Documentation** requires standardized views showing all features from multiple angles
3. **Quality control** depends on GD&T callouts for inspection criteria
4. **Communication** with vendors and partners requires industry-standard drawing formats

Without proper 2D drafting, users would need to export to other CAD tools for drawing creation, breaking the parametric link between 3D model and 2D documentation.

## Solution

Full 2D drafting system with orthographic/isometric projections, hidden line removal, dimensions, and GD&T annotations.

### Orthographic Projections

Standard views that project 3D geometry onto 2D planes:

| View | Direction | Shows |
|------|-----------|-------|
| Front | Looking along +Y | XZ plane (width x height) |
| Back | Looking along -Y | XZ plane (mirrored) |
| Top | Looking along -Z | XY plane (width x depth) |
| Bottom | Looking along +Z | XY plane (mirrored) |
| Right | Looking along +X | YZ plane (depth x height) |
| Left | Looking along -X | YZ plane (mirrored) |

### Isometric Projection

3D-like view for visualization with configurable azimuth and elevation angles:

- **Standard Isometric:** 30 degrees azimuth, 30 degrees elevation
- **Dimetric:** 26.57 degrees (arctan 0.5) for technical drawings

### Hidden Line Removal

Edges are classified as visible or hidden based on occlusion:

- **Visible edges:** Solid lines (not blocked by any face)
- **Hidden edges:** Dashed lines (occluded by geometry)

Edge types extracted from mesh:

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Sharp | Angle between adjacent faces exceeds threshold (default 30 degrees) |
| Silhouette | Boundary between front-facing and back-facing faces |
| Boundary | Edge with only one adjacent face (mesh boundary) |

### Dimension Types

| Dimension | Description | Use Case |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| Linear | Horizontal, vertical, aligned, or rotated | Overall dimensions, feature locations |
| Angular | Angle between two edges or three points | Chamfers, tapers, angular features |
| Radial | Radius or diameter of arcs/circles | Holes, fillets, cylindrical features |
| Ordinate | Datum-relative coordinate dimensions | Hole patterns, feature positions from datum |

### GD&T Support

Full geometric dimensioning and tolerancing per ASME Y14.5-2018:

**Form Tolerances** (no datum required):
- Straightness, Flatness, Circularity, Cylindricity

**Profile Tolerances:**
- Profile of a Line, Profile of a Surface

**Orientation Tolerances** (require datum):
- Angularity, Perpendicularity, Parallelism

**Location Tolerances** (require datum):
- Position, Concentricity, Symmetry

**Runout Tolerances** (require datum):
- Circular Runout, Total Runout

**Material Conditions:**
- MMC (Maximum Material Condition)
- LMC (Least Material Condition)
- RFS (Regardless of Feature Size, implicit)

### Section Views

Cut through geometry to show internal features:

- **Horizontal sections:** Cut at specified Z height
- **Front sections:** Cut at specified Y depth
- **Right sections:** Cut at specified X position
- **Custom planes:** Arbitrary origin and normal
- **Hatch patterns:** Configurable spacing and angle (default 45 degrees at 2mm)

### Detail Views

Magnified regions for fine features:

- Specify center, width, height, and scale factor
- Label with letters (A, B, C, etc.)
- Automatically extracts and scales edges from parent view

## UX Details

### Data Structures

interface DrawingState {
  viewMode: "3d" | "2d";
  viewDirection: ViewDirection;
  showHiddenLines: boolean;
  showDimensions: boolean;
  zoom: number;

}
```

### Projection Algorithm

```
1. Build view matrix from view direction
   - Compute right, up, forward vectors
   - Ensure orthogonality
2. Extract edges from mesh
   - Find sharp edges (face angle > threshold)
   - Find silhouette edges (front-back face boundary)
   - Find boundary edges (single adjacent face)
3. For each edge:
   a. Project endpoints to 2D using view matrix
   b. Compute midpoint depth
   c. Test visibility against all triangles
   d. Classify as Visible or Hidden
4. Return ProjectedView with all edges and bounds
```

### Section Algorithm

```
1. For each triangle in mesh:
   - Compute vertex distances to cutting plane
   - Find edge-plane intersections (0, 1, or 2 points)
   - If 2 points, add segment to list
2. Chain segments into polylines:
   - Use tolerance-based endpoint matching
   - Build adjacency graph
   - Traverse to form continuous curves
3. Project 3D curves to 2D on section plane
4. If hatching enabled:
   - For each closed curve (boundary)
   - Generate parallel lines at specified angle/spacing
   - Clip to boundary, subtract holes
5. Return SectionView with curves and hatch lines
```

# Generative Design (Topology Optimization)

AI-driven topology optimization for vcad. Define a design space and loading conditions, then optimize material distribution to minimize weight while meeting structural requirements.

## Overview

Topology optimization answers the question: "Given a design envelope and loads, where should material be placed?" Unlike traditional CAD where designers manually create geometry, generative design explores the full design space algorithmically.

**Key benefits:**
- Weight reduction of 40-70% compared to traditional designs
- Organic, load-optimized geometries
- Manufacturing-aware results (additive, casting, machining)
- Integration with vcad's parametric workflow

## Algorithm: SIMP (Solid Isotropic Material with Penalization)

SIMP is the industry-standard method for density-based topology optimization. Each element in the design space has a pseudo-density value that determines material presence.

### Mathematical Formulation

**Density field:** Each element has density ρ ∈ [0, 1]
- ρ = 0: void (no material)
- ρ = 1: solid (full material)
- Intermediate values are penalized to drive toward 0/1

**Interpolation scheme (modified SIMP):**
```
E(ρ) = E_min + ρ^p × (E_0 - E_min)
```

Where:
- `E(ρ)` = effective Young's modulus at density ρ
- `E_0` = base material Young's modulus
- `E_min` = small value to prevent singularity (typically 10⁻⁹ × E_0)
- `p` = penalization exponent (typically 3)

The penalty exponent p > 1 makes intermediate densities inefficient, driving the solution toward a clear 0/1 distribution.

### Objective Function (Compliance Minimization)

The standard formulation minimizes structural compliance (maximizes stiffness):

```
minimize:  C = U^T × K × U       (total strain energy)

subject to:
    K(ρ) × U = F                 (equilibrium equation)
    Σ ρ_e × v_e ≤ V_target       (volume constraint)
    0 < ρ_min ≤ ρ_e ≤ 1          (density bounds)
```

Where:
- `U` = global displacement vector
- `K` = global stiffness matrix (function of densities)
- `F` = applied force vector
- `v_e` = element volume
- `V_target` = target volume fraction × total volume

### Sensitivity Analysis

Gradients computed via adjoint method:

```
∂C/∂ρ_e = -p × ρ_e^(p-1) × u_e^T × K_0 × u_e
```

Where `u_e` is the element displacement vector and `K_0` is the element stiffness matrix at unit density.

### Optimizer: MMA (Method of Moving Asymptotes)

MMA is the de facto standard optimizer for topology optimization:
- Handles large numbers of design variables (millions)
- Efficiently incorporates multiple constraints
- Self-adaptive move limits via asymptote updates
- Proven convergence for SIMP problems

Alternative for MVP: Optimality Criteria (OC) method - simpler but less robust for multiple constraints.

## Filtering

Filtering prevents numerical artifacts and provides mesh-independence.

### Density Filter (Prevents Checkerboarding)

Weighted average of neighboring densities:
```
ρ̃_e = Σ_j (w_ej × ρ_j) / Σ_j w_ej

w_ej = max(0, r - dist(e,j))
```

Where `r` is the filter radius (typically 1.5-2× element size).

### Sensitivity Filter

Chain rule modification for filtered sensitivities:
```
∂C/∂ρ_e = (1/ρ_e) × Σ_j (w_ej × ρ_j × ∂C/∂ρ̃_j) / Σ_j w_ej
```

### Heaviside Projection (Optional)

Further sharpens 0/1 boundaries:
```
ρ̄ = (tanh(β×η) + tanh(β×(ρ̃-η))) / (tanh(β×η) + tanh(β×(1-η)))
```

Where β controls sharpness (increased during optimization) and η is the threshold.

## FEA Integration

### Browser-Based FEA (Small Problems)

For problems under ~64³ voxels (~260K elements):
- WASM-compiled FEM solver
- WebGPU-accelerated matrix operations
- Iterative solver (PCG with Jacobi preconditioner)
- Hex8 elements with reduced integration

### Cloud Backend (Large Problems)

For larger problems, delegate to cloud FEA:
- **FEniCS**: Python-based, flexible, good for prototyping
- **Code_Aster**: Production-grade, comprehensive capabilities
- **PETSc**: Scalable parallel solvers

Communication via vcad's existing cloud infrastructure.

## Design Space Definition

### Workflow

1. **Design envelope**: Select existing solid as maximum design space
2. **Preserved regions**: Surfaces/volumes that must remain solid
   - Mounting faces
   - Bolt holes
   - Bearing surfaces
3. **Exclusion zones**: Volumes where material cannot exist
   - Clearance for moving parts
   - Cable routing
4. **Voxelization**: Convert to regular grid
   - Default resolution: 64³
   - User-configurable up to 256³ in browser

### Voxelization Algorithm

1. Compute AABB of design envelope
2. Create regular hex grid at specified resolution
3. Point-in-solid test for each voxel center
4. Mark preserved/excluded regions
5. Generate element connectivity

## Load and Boundary Conditions

### Boundary Conditions

| Type | Application | Description |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| Fixed | Face/Edge/Vertex | Zero displacement (all DOFs) |
| Pinned | Vertex | Zero translation, free rotation |
| Roller | Face | Normal displacement = 0 |
| Symmetry | Face | Symmetric displacement |

### Loads

| Type | Application | Description |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| Point Force | Vertex | Concentrated force vector |
| Distributed Force | Face | Force per unit area |
| Pressure | Face | Normal surface pressure |
| Gravity | Volume | Body force from acceleration |
| Moment | Edge | Applied torque |

### Multiple Load Cases

Support for multiple independent load cases:
```
minimize: Σ_i w_i × C_i

subject to: K × U_i = F_i  for each load case i
```

Weights `w_i` balance importance of each load case.

## Manufacturing Constraints

### Additive Manufacturing (3D Printing)

**Overhang constraint:**
- Critical angle: typically 45° from horizontal
- Prevents unsupported overhangs that require support material

**Self-supporting filter:**
```
ρ̄_layer(x,y) = max(ρ(x,y,z), min(ρ(x±Δ,y±Δ,z-Δz)))
```

Process layer-by-layer from build plate, ensuring each layer is supported by the previous.

**Minimum feature size:**
- Controlled via filter radius
- Matches printer resolution capabilities

### Casting and Molding

**Draw direction constraint:**
- Single draw: monotonic density along parting direction
- Split draw: monotonic from parting plane in both directions

**Implementation:**
Cast rays along draw direction; enforce density ordering:
```
ρ(x,y,z) ≤ ρ(x,y,z+Δz)  for positive draw direction
```

**No undercuts:**
- Prevent features that would lock the mold

### CNC Machining

**Accessibility constraint:**
- All surfaces must be reachable by cutting tool
- Define tool geometry (diameter, length, type)
- Specify fixturing orientations

**Visibility filter:**
Project from each machining direction; occluded regions cannot be void.

### Extrusion

**2.5D constraint:**
- Constant density along extrusion direction
- Reduces to 2D optimization problem

```
ρ(x,y,z) = ρ(x,y)  for all z
```

## Result Processing: Voxel to BRep

### Pipeline Overview

```
Density Grid → Threshold → SDF → Marching Cubes → Mesh → Smooth → BRep
```

### Step 1: Threshold and SDF Generation

Convert density field to signed distance field:
```python
sdf[i,j,k] = ρ[i,j,k] - 0.5  # Simple threshold
```

For smoother results, use distance transform on thresholded field.

### Step 2: Isosurface Extraction (Marching Cubes)

- Extract triangle mesh at SDF = 0 isosurface
- WebGPU-accelerated implementation
- Output: indexed triangle mesh

### Step 3: Mesh Smoothing

**Laplacian smoothing:**
```
v_new = v + λ × (v_avg_neighbors - v)
```

**HC algorithm** (volume-preserving):
- Two-step process prevents shrinkage
- Better preserves sharp features

### Step 4: NURBS Surface Fitting (Optional)

For high-quality BRep output:
1. Segment mesh into regions of similar curvature
2. Fit B-spline surfaces to each region
3. Trim and sew into watertight solid

### Step 5: BRep Assembly

1. Create faces from fitted surfaces
2. Build half-edge topology
3. Validate solid (closed, manifold, consistent orientation)
4. Export to STEP or integrate into vcad document

| Large | >1M | >100³ | Full cloud | >10s |

### Performance Targets

| Configuration | Target |
|---------------|--------|
| 100K elements, browser | <10 seconds total (50 iterations) |
| 1M elements, GPU | ~2 minutes total |
| 10M elements, cloud | ~20 minutes total |
| 65M elements, multi-GPU | ~2 hours total |
